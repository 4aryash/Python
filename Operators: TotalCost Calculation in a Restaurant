#Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.
#Note: Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result!
